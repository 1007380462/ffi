== 0.3.0 / 2009-03-19
* Switch compilation to rake-compiler
  * Makes cross-compilation from linux -> win32 super easy
  * win32 support is available now, but highly experimental

* Performance improvements
  * struct field access approx 3x faster than 0.2.0
  * function invocation approx 20% faster than 0.2.0

* A bunch of minor improvements
  * Struct instances can now be passed as :pointer parameters without calling
    Struct#pointer
  * Support for array struct members
  * Structs are now padded correctly to the alignment of the struct's  
    largest field
  * Global library variables
  * Callbacks in global library variables
  * Strings passed in as :string arguments are scrubbed to avoid 
    poison-null-byte attacks.
  * Union support
  * nil can be passed as a :string argument (passed as NULL)
  * Structs can now be fields inside another struct
  * Lots of internal cleanups and refactorings.
